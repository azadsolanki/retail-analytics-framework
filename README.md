SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_orders,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_customers,
    ROUND(SUM(order_total), 2) as total_revenue
FROM {{ ref('fct_orders') }}
WHERE order_status = 'Complete';
```

## 🧪 Enterprise Data Quality Framework

### **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**

**Production Data Quality Approach**: This framework handles realistic retail data quality challenges professionally, treating data issues as business requirements rather than technical problems.

| Test Category | Coverage | Business Impact |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Data Integrity** | Primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness | Prevents analytical errors |
| **Business Rules** | Age ranges, valid statuses, logical constraints | Ensures business logic compliance |
| **Data Freshness** | Source data recency, processing windows | Maintains timely insights |
| **Relationship Tests** | Foreign key validation, ERD generation | Enables automated documentation |
| **Custom Validation** | Retail-specific rules, cross-model consistency | Domain expertise demonstration |

### **Relationship Tests for ERD**
*Relationship tests serve dual purposes: data quality validation and ERD generation*

```yaml
# Example: Relationship test in _core_models.yml
models:
  - name: fct_orders
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        tests:
          - relationships:
              to: ref('dim_users')
              field: user_id
              config:
                severity: warn
```

### **Known Data Quality Patterns**
*Professional approach to realistic retail data challenges:*

```yaml
# Example: Handling duplicate customer emails (realistic business scenario)
tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: email
      config:
        severity: warn                    # Business decision: warn, don't fail
        error_if: ">5000"                # Escalate if problem grows significantly  
        warn_if: ">0"                    # Always log for monitoring
        where: "email IS NOT NULL"       # Focus on meaningful duplicates
```

**Business Context**: In production retail environments:
- ✅ **Age outliers** (870 records) - Handled with business rules, not data rejection
- ✅ **Email duplicates** (3,702 records) - Managed through recency-based deduplication
- ✅ **Referential gaps** (16,395 records) - Filtered with proper logging and monitoring

## 🚢 Deployment & Operations

### **CI/CD Workflow**
*Automated deployment pipeline*

```bash
# CI automatically runs on every push:
# 1. Compile - Validates syntax
# 2. Build - Runs models in ephemeral dataset
# 3. Test - Executes all data tests
# 4. ERD - Generates diagram (on merge to main)
```

### **Manual Development Workflow**
```bash
# Local development
dbt deps                          # Install packages
dbt compile                       # Validate models
dbt run --select tag:staging      # Build staging layer
dbt test --select tag:staging     # Validate staging data

# Full pipeline execution
dbt run                           # Build all models
dbt test                          # Run all tests
dbt docs generate                 # Generate documentation
dbt docs serve                    # Serve documentation locally
```

### **Data Quality Management**
- **Test Coverage**: 60+ tests across all layers with appropriate severity levels
- **Relationship Tests**: Enable automatic ERD generation
- **Quality Monitoring**: Automated execution in CI pipeline
- **Issue Resolution**: Systematic approach to data quality exceptions
